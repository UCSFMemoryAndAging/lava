	<!-- these abstract beans are for example purposes only. applications should define their own
		CRMS repository beans because the rootPath and archiveRoot locations are specific to a given
		application server environment.
		The repository bean could use the lava-core BaseFileRepository class.
		The strategy bean could use CrmsRepositoryStrategy but is may be desired that generateFileId
		and generateLocation should be overridden so an app strategy subclass would be created to 
		override these methods (otherwise the implementations in lava-core LocalFileSystemRepositoryStrategy
		would be used)
		In this case, make sure that the app sets the respositoryId property on all instantiated
		LavaFile or CrmsFile or subclasses that should use the repository and strategy to whatever
		id is configured in the repository bean (e.g. "lava_crms" below), as this is used to determine
		which repository / strategy should handle the file.
		
		note: if these beans were not abstract and there were no conflicting beans in the app then
		crms attachments would work using the rootPath and archiveRoot configured here and using
		the generateFileId and generateLocation implementations in lava-core LocalFileSystemRepositoryStrategy
