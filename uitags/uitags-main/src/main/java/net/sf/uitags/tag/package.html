  <p>Tag handlers should contain logic, performing whatever processing
     and calculation needed. On the other hand, templates should contain
     static string for generated HTML and JavaScript. The templates should
     not contain complicated logic. Configurable values
     should not be specified in the template, they should go to the
     properties file.</p>
  <h3>Tag Handlers and Instance Variables</h3>
  <p>An object may be used as a tag handler's instance variable for holding
     states (set via the setter methods) only if its state never changes once
     the setters have all been invoked. Otherwise, temporary instance variables
     should be used in its place. Inside <code>doStartTag()</code> (or
     <code>doEndTag()</code>, etc), information is transferred from the
     temporary variables to initialize the original object's states. This
     avoids bugs due to reuse of tag handlers.
