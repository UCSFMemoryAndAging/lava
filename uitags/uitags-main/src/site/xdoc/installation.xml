      <p>
        To use uitags in your project, simply place
        uitags-main-&lt;version&gt;.jar and its runtime dependencies in your
        webapp's WEB-INF/lib directory. When we say "runtime dependencies",
        we mean jar files that must be placed in WEB-INF/lib alongside uitags
        jar file in order for it to work.
      </p>

    <section name="Dependency Note">
      <p>
        You can view the dependency list <a href="dependencies.html">here</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Please note:</b> many of the dependency packages are not needed
        at runtime; they're required only for building and testing uitags.
        If you don't want EL support (perhaps because your servlet engine
        provides built-in EL support), Jakarta Taglib's standard.jar is not
        needed at runtime.
