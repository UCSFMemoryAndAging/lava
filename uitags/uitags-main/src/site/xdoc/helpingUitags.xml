    <section name="Why Help uitags">
      <p>
        Because it benefits all its users, including yourself. Everything in
        this package is contributed by volunteers. If everyone
        chips in a little uitags will grow better, faster.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section name="How to Help uitags">
      <p>
        You can help the project in many ways. One way of doing so is by
        making code contribution, such as submitting patches or bug fixes.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you aren't proficient in developing custom tags, you can still
        contribute by giving ideas and suggestions (perhaps how to make
        uitags even easier to use, or which new features you would like to
        have), improving documentation, or helping out in the forum.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally and <b>most importantly</b>, we encourage you to <b>spread
        the word</b> about uitags. Tell your friends about this package.
        If you use uitags in your web application, perhaps you can place
        a link to the project homepage (if circumstances permit).
        Having a wider exposure will give
        the project and its users great benefits. The more users
        uitags has, the more help and contribution it will receive,
        thereby enhancing further its usefulness and quality.
