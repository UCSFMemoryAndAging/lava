    <section name="Introduction">
      <p>
        <strong>uitags</strong> is an open source JSP custom-tag library
        (taglib) that makes developing <em>friendly</em> UI (user interface)
        <em>effortless</em>. It aims to help developers
        create interactive UIs that let end-users work more efficiently.
        Its collection includes tags for well-known UI
        components, such as formGuide, calendar, optionTransfer, and panel.
      </p>
      <p>
        uitags v1 is the successor to
        <a href="http://uitags.sourceforge.net/0.x">uitags v0 (the current stable version)</a>.
        It's being actively developed and is still not final. Its public
        API may change until it hits the first stable release. Generally
        uitags v1 is stable enough for production use. We encourage users
        to choose uitags v1 over v0 as new improvements will only go to v1.

    <section name="Why Use uitags">
      <subsection name="There are plenty of JavaScript libraries out there. Why use uitags?">
        <p>
          Using a taglib lets you write more <b>robust code</b> as
          you catch errors easier and earlier.
          Modern IDEs are capable of validating custom tag usage
          on-the-fly while you write your code. Furthermore, web
          containers use TLD to enforce proper use of custom tags.
          You discover coding errors without
          having to open up a browser.
        </p>
        <p>
          Custom tags, having XML-like syntax, blend in with the
          rest of your HTML code, making it <b>easier to read</b>.
          Using uitags, often you write <b>shorter and more intuitive</b>
          code. For example, to create a panel you write the following:
          <pre>
            &lt;uic:panel ...&gt;Panel contents&lt;/uic:panel&gt;
          </pre>
          When someone sees that piece of code they know that it
          renders a panel. Using JavaScript, they'd only see a
          standard HTML element (likely a &lt;div&gt;) which is
          turned into a panel by a JavaScript code located elsewhere.
          This leads to hard-to-comprehend code.
        </p>
      </subsection>
      <subsection name="Flexibility">
        <p>
          To give you full flexibility, uitags since v1 no longer
          renders widgets for you (there's a few exceptions to this).
          This means that you are <b>free</b> to use whatever technique
          to render a widget. You could use your MVC framework's
          custom tags, or write plain HTML. You then use uitags
          to inject rich client-side behavior to the widget. We call
          this technique "behavior injection".
        </p>
        <p>
          Here's an example of how to turn an image into a date-picker button:
          <pre>
            &lt;!-- You have full freedom in creating and styling your image --&gt;
            &lt;img id="trigger" ... /&gt;
            &lt;!-- And then using uitags you inject dynamic behavior to your image --&gt;
            &lt;uic:show injectTo="trigger" on="click" /&gt;
          </pre>
        </p>
      </subsection>
      <subsection name="Extensibility">
        <p>
          uitags lets you hook into its JavaScript code by providing
          listeners and strategy classes. As a testimony to uitags'
          extensibility, we managed to glue together two completely
          separate uitags suites, <i>panel</i> and <i>calendar</i>, by
          providing listeners. We then implemented a simple strategy
          class to turn them into a fully-featured date picker. See the demo at
          <a href="http://www.gani.com.au/uitags1/comboDatePicker.jsp">http://www.gani.com.au/uitags1/comboDatePicker.jsp</a>.
