	<!-- for reports that essentially print a view, e.g. an entity view or a list view, the suffix "Report" is added 
		 to the view name by CustomReportSelector (called during the flow).
	     this is matched against a bean name in this file.
	     this suffix is appended so that views that have both a jsp file and report design file will be resolved differently. 
	     for reasons related to Spring, the reportViewResolver must be in the view resolver chain before the jspViewResolver.
	     so for jsp views, since they will not have "Report" appended, they will not be resolved by any beans in this 
	     file, and will be passed on to the jspViewResolver -->

	<!--TODO: create separate core-reports.xml files for production and development:
	
		the development version will refer to the source report design files (.jrxml) in the WEB-INF/report directory tree.
		note that edu.ucsf.lava.crms.reporting.controller.CustomJasperReportsMultiFormatView used below overrides the Spring
		JasperReportsMultiFormatView class, and compiles the report .jrxml file every time it is accessed.
		
		the production version will refer to the compiled report design files (.jasper) stored in a different directory tree,
		which must be pre-compiled (see Jasper docs for precompiling reports). the production version can be used in development
		when not working on reports so that all the reports are not compiled every time the webapp is deployed. -->
