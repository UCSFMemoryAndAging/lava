# rules on single quotes: 
# if the msg contains replacement variables, a single quote must be coded as two consecutive single quotes
# because the msg is processed by the java.text.MessageFormat class
# otherwise, the msg is not processed by MessageFormat, so a single quote is coded as a single quote
